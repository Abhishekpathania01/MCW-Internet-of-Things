# Internet of Things hands-on lab step-by-step

Updated June 2018

In this hands-on lab, you will implement an end-to-end IoT solution simulating high velocity data emitted from smart meters and analyzed in Azure. You will design a lambda architecture, filtering a subset of the telemetry data for real-time visualization on the hot path, and storing all the data in long-term storage for the cold path. After completing the hands-on lab, you will have a better understanding of implementing device registration with the IoT Hub Device Provisioning Service and visualizing hot data with Power BI.

## Abstract

In this hands-on lab, you will construct an end-to-end IoT solution simulating high velocity data emitted from smart meters and analyzed in Azure. You will design a lambda architecture, filtering a subset of the telemetry data for real-time visualization on the hot path, and storing all the data in long-term storage for the cold path.

At the end of this hands-on lab, you will be better able to build an IoT solution implementing device registration with the IoT Hub Device Provisioning Service and visualizing hot data with Power BI.

## Overview

Fabrikam provides services and smart meters for enterprise energy (electrical power) management. Their "*You-Left-The-Light-On*" service enables the enterprise to understand their energy consumption.

## Solution architecture

Below is a diagram of the solution architecture you will build in this lab. Please study this carefully, so you understand the whole of the solution as you are working on the various components.

![Diagram of the preferred solution. From a high-level, the commerce solution uses an API App to host the Payments web service with which the Vending Machine interacts to conduct purchase transactions. The Payment Web API invokes a 3rd party payment gateway as needed for authorizing and capturing credit card payments, and logs the purchase transaction to SQL DB. The data for these purchase transactions is stored using an In-Memory table with a Columnar Index, which will support the write-heavy workload while still allowing analytics to operate, such as queries coming from Power BI Desktop.](./media/preferred-solution-architecture.png "Preferred high-level architecture")

## Requirements

* Microsoft Azure subscription must be pay-as-you-go or MSDN
  * Trial subscriptions will not work
* A virtual machine configured with:
  * Visual Studio Community 2017 15.6 or later
  * Azure SDK 2.9 or later (Included with Visual Studio 2017)
* A running Azure Databricks cluster (see [Before the hands-on lab](#before-the-hands-on-lab))

## Exercise 1: IoT Hub provisioning

Duration: 15 minutes

In your architecture design session with Fabrikam, it was agreed that you would use an Azure IoT Hub to manage both the device registration and telemetry ingest from the Smart Meter Simulator. Your team also identified the Microsoft provided Device Explorer project that Fabrikam can use to view the list and status of devices in the IoT Hub registry.

### Task 1: Provision IoT Hub

In these steps, you will provision an instance of IoT Hub.

1. In your browser, navigate to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), select **+Create a resource** in the navigation pane, enter "iot" into the Search the Marketplace box, select **IoT Hub** from the results, and select **Create**.

    ![+Create a resource is highlighted in the navigation page of the Azure portal, and "iot" is entered into the Search the Marketplace box. IoT Hub is highlighted in the search results.](./media/create-resource-iot-hub.png "Create an IoT Hub")

2. On the IoT Hub blade Basics tab, enter the following:

    * **Subscription**: Select the subscription you are using for this hands-on lab

    * **Resource group**: Choose Use existing and select the hands-on-lab-SUFFIX resource group

    * **Region**: Select the location you are using for this hands-on lab

    * **IoT Hub Name**: Enter a unique name, such as smartmeter-hub-SUFFIX

        ![The Basics blade for IoT Hub is displayed, with the values specified above entered into the appropriate fields.](./media/iot-hub-basics-blade.png "Create IoT Hub Basic blade")

    * Select **Next: Size and Scale**.

    * On the Size and scale blade, accept the default Pricing and scale tier of S1: Standard tier, and select **Review + create**.

    * Select **Create** on the Review + create blade.

3. When the IoT Hub deployment is completed, you will receive a notification in the Azure portal. Select **Go to resource** in the notification.

    ![Screenshot of the Deployment succeeded message, with the Go to resource button highlighted.](./media/iot-hub-deployment-succeeded.png "Deployment succeeded message")

4. From the IoT Hub's Overview blade, select **Shared access policies** under Settings on the left-hand menu.

    ![Screenshot of the Overview blade, settings section. Under Settings, Shared access policies is highlighted.](./media/iot-hub-shared-access-policies.png "Overview blade, settings section")

5. Select **iothubowner** policy.

    ![The Azure portal is shown with the iothubowner selected.](./media/iot-hub-shared-access-policies-iothubowner.png "IoT Hub Owner shared access policy")

6. In the **iothubowner** blade, select the Copy button to the right of the **Connection string - primary key** field. You will be pasting the connection string value into a TextBox's Text property value in the next task.

    ![Screenshot of the iothubowner blade. The connection string - primary key field is highlighted.](./media/iot-hub-shared-access-policies-iothubowner-blade.png "iothubowner blade")

### Task 2: Configure the Smart Meter Simulator

If you want to save this connection string with your project (in case you stop debugging or otherwise close the simulator), you can set this as the default text for the text box. Follow these steps to configure the connection string:

1. Return to the `SmartMeterSimulator` solution in Visual Studio on your Lab VM.

2. In the Solution Explorer, double-click `MainForm.cs` to open it. (If the Solution Explorer is not in the upper left corner of your Visual Studio instance, you can find it under the View menu in Visual Studio.)

    ![In the Visual Studio Solution Explorer window, SmartMeterSimulator is expanded, and under it, MainForm.cs is highlighted.](media/visual-studio-solution-explorer-mainform-cs.png "Visual Studio Solution Explorer")

3. In the Windows Forms designer surface, click the **IoT Hub Connection String TextBox** to select it.

    ![The Windows Form designer surface is opened to the MainForm.cs tab. The IoT Hub Connection String is highlighted, but is empty.](./media/smart-meter-simulator-iot-hub-connection-string.png "Windows Form designer surface")

4. In the Properties panel, scroll until you see the **Text** property. Paste your IoT Hub connection string value copied in step 7 of the previous task into the value for the Text property. (If the properties window is not visible below the Solution Explorer, right-click the TextBox, and select **Properties**.)

    ![In the Properties panel, the Text property is highlighted, and is set to HostName=smartmeter-hub.](./media/smart-meter-simulator-iot-hub-connection-string-text-property.png "Solution Explorer")

5. Your connection string should now be present every time you run the Smart Meter Simulator.

    ![The Windows Form designer surface is opened to the MainForm.cs tab. The IoT Hub Connection String now displays.](./media/smart-meter-simulator-iot-hub-connection-string-populated.png "IoT Hub Connection String dialog")

6. Save `MainForm.cs`.

## Exercise 2: Completing the Smart Meter Simulator

Duration: 60 minutes

Fabrikam has left you a partially completed sample in the form of the Smart Meter Simulator solution. You will need to complete the missing lines of code that deal with device registration management and device telemetry transmission that communicate with your IoT Hub.

### Task 1: Implement device management with the IoT Hub

1. In Visual Studio on your Lab VM, use Solution Explorer to open the file `DeviceManager.cs`.

2. From the Visual Studio **View** menu, click **Task List**.

    ![On the Visual Studio View menu, Task List is selected.](media/visual-studio-view-menu-task-list.png "Visual Studio View menu")

3. In the Task List, you will see a list of `TODO` tasks, where each task represents one line of code that needs to be completed. Complete the line of code below each `TODO` using the code below as a reference.

4. The following code represents the completed tasks in `DeviceManager.cs`:

    ```csharp
    class DeviceManager
    {
        static string connectionString;
        static RegistryManager registryManager;

        public static string HostName { get; set; }

        public static void IotHubConnect(string cnString)
        {
            connectionString = cnString;

            //TODO: 1.Create an instance of RegistryManager from connectionString
            registryManager = RegistryManager.CreateFromConnectionString(connectionString);

            var builder = IotHubConnectionStringBuilder.Create(cnString);

            HostName = builder.HostName;
        }

            }
        }
    }
    ```
5. Save `DeviceManager.cs`.

### Task 2: Implement the communication of telemetry with the IoT Hub

1. Open `Sensor.cs` from the Solution Explorer, and complete the `TODO` items indicated within the code that are responsible for transmitting telemetry data to the IoT Hub.

2. The following code shows the completed result:

    ```csharp
    class Sensor
    {
        private DeviceClient _DeviceClient;
        private string _IotHubUri { get; set; }
        public string DeviceId { get; set; }
        public string DeviceKey { get; set; }
        public DeviceState State { get; set; }
        public string StatusWindow { get; set; }
        public double CurrentTemperature
        {
            get
            {
                double avgTemperature = 70;
                Random rand = new Random();

                double currentTemperature = avgTemperature + rand.Next(-6, 6);

                if(currentTemperature <= 68)
                    TemperatureIndicator = SensorState.Cold;
                else if(currentTemperature > 68 && currentTemperature < 72)
                    TemperatureIndicator = SensorState.Normal;
                else if(currentTemperature >= 72)
                    TemperatureIndicator = SensorState.Hot;

                return currentTemperature;
            }
        }

        public SensorState TemperatureIndicator { get; set; }

        public Sensor(string iotHubUri, string deviceId, string deviceKey)
        {
            _IotHubUri = iotHubUri;
            DeviceId = deviceId;
            DeviceKey = deviceKey;
            State = DeviceState.Registered;
        }

        public void InstallDevice(string statusWindow)
        {
            StatusWindow = statusWindow;
            State = DeviceState.Installed;
        }

        /// <summary>
        /// Connect a device to the IoT Hub by instantiating a DeviceClient for that Device by Id and Key.
        /// </summary>
        public void ConnectDevice()
        {
            //TODO: 17. Connect the Device to Iot Hub by creating an instance of DeviceClient
            _DeviceClient = DeviceClient.Create(_IotHubUri, new DeviceAuthenticationWithRegistrySymmetricKey(DeviceId, DeviceKey));

            //Set the Device State to Ready
            State = DeviceState.Ready;
        }

        public void DisconnectDevice()
        {
            //Delete the local device client
            _DeviceClient = null;

            //Set the Device State to Activate
            State = DeviceState.Activated;
        }

        /// <summary>
        /// Send a message to the IoT Hub from the Smart Meter device
        /// </summary>
        public async void SendMessageAsync()
        {
            var telemetryDataPoint = new
            {
                id = DeviceId,
                time = DateTime.UtcNow.ToString("o"),
                temp = CurrentTemperature
            };

            //TODO: 18.Serialize the telemetryDataPoint to JSON
            var messageString = JsonConvert.SerializeObject(telemetryDataPoint);

            //TODO: 19.Encode the JSON string to ASCII as bytes and create new Message with the bytes
            var message = new Message(Encoding.ASCII.GetBytes(messageString));

            //TODO: 20.Send the message to the IoT Hub
            var sendEventAsync = _DeviceClient?.SendEventAsync(message);
            if (sendEventAsync != null) await sendEventAsync;
        }
    }
    ```
3. Save `Sensor.cs`.

### Task 3: Verify device registration and telemetry

In this task, you will build and run the Smart Meter Simulator project.

1. In Visual Studio select Build from the Visual Studio menu, then select Build Solution.

2. Run the Smart Meter Simulator, by selecting the green Start button on the Visual Studio toolbar.

    ![The green Start button is highlighted on the Visual Studio toolbar.](media/visual-studio-toolbar-start.png "Visual Studio toolbar")

## Exercise 6: Reporting device outages with IoT Hub Operations Monitoring

Duration: 20 minutes

Fabrikam would like to be alerted when devices disconnect and fail to reconnect after a period. Since they are already using PowerBI to visualize hot data, they would like to see a list of any of these devices in a report.

### Task 1: Enable verbose connection monitoring on the IoT Hub

To keep track of device connects and disconnects, we first need to enable verbose connection monitoring.

1.  In your browser, navigate to the **Azure Portal** (<https://portal.azure.com)>.

2.  Open the IoT Hub you provisioned earlier, **smart-meter**.

3.  Under SETTINGS in the left-hand menu, click on **Operations monitoring**.
    
    ![Under Settings, Operations monitoring is selected.](./media/image99.png "Settings section")

4.  Select **Verbose** for **Log events when a device connects or disconnects from the IoT Hub**.

    ![In the Monitoring categories section, Verbose is selected under Log events when a device connects or disconnects from the IoT Hub.](./media/image100.png "Monitoring categories section")

5.  Click **Save**.

### Task 2: Collect device connection telemetry with the hot path Stream Analytics job

Now that the device connections are being logged, update your hot path Stream Analytics job (the first one you created) with a new input that ingests device telemetry from Operations Monitoring. Next, create a query that joins all connected and disconnected events with a DATEDIFF function that only returns devices with a disconnect event, but no reconnect event within 120 seconds. Output the events to Power BI.

1.  In your browser, navigate to the **Azure Portal** (<https://portal.azure.com)>.

2.  Open the **hot-stream** Stream Analytics job (the first one you created).

3.  Stop the job if it is currently running, from the Overview blade, by selecting **Stop**, then **Yes** when prompted.
    
    ![The Stop button is highlighted on the Overview blade top menu.](./media/image101.png "Overview blade Stop button")

4.  Select **Inputs** on the left-hand menu, under Job Topology.

    ![Under Job Topology, Inputs is selected.](./media/image49.png "Job Topology Section")

5.  On the Inputs blade, select **+Add**, then **IoT Hub** to add an input connected to your IoT Hub.
    
    ![Add new IoT Hub stream input to Stream Analytics](./media/image50.png "Job topolog add stream input hub")

6.  On the New Input blade, enter the following:

  * Input Alias: Set the value to **connections**.

  * Import Option: Choose **Select IoT hub from your subscriptions**.

  * IoT Hub: Select your existing IoT Hub, **smartmeter-hub**.

  * Endpoint: Choose **Operations monitoring**.

  * Shared Access Policy Name: Set to **Service**.

  * Consumer Group: Leave as **\$Default**.

  * Event serialization format: Choose **JSON**.

  * Encoding: Choose **UTF-8**.

  * Event compression type: Leave set to **None**.

        ![Create new IoT Hub input form for Stream Analytics](./media/image102.png "IoT hub new input blade")

  * Select **Save**.

7. Now, select **Outputs** from the left-hand menu, under Job Topology.

    ![Under Job Topology, Outputs is selected.](./media/image52.png "Job Topology Section")

8. In the Outputs blade, select **+Add**, the **Power BI**, to add the output destination for the query.
    
    ![Select +Add, then Power BI within the outputs blade of your Stream Analytics instance](./media/image53.png "Outputs blade add Power BI")

9. On the New output blade, enter the following:

  * Set the **Output alias** to **powerbi-outage**.

        ![Enter powerbi-outage for the output alias, then select Authorize to authenticate to your Power BI subscription](./media/image103.png "Poewr BI new output")

  * Select **Authorize** under Authorize Connection.

    Follow the on-screen prompts to log on to your Power BI account.

    After authenticating, complete the remaining fields as follows:

  * Group Workspace: Leave set to **My Workspace**.

  * Dataset Name: Enter **deviceoutage**

  * Table Name: Enter **deviceoutage**

  * Select **Save**.

        ![Complete the form by entering deviceoutage as both the Dataset name and Table name. Select the My workspace Group workspace option](./media/image104.png "Power BI new input ")

10. Next, select **Query** from the left-hand menu, under Job Topology.
    
    ![Under Job Topology, Query is selected.](./media/image56.png "Job Topology Section")

11. We will replace the hot path query, which selects the averages of the temperatures into the PowerBI output, with queries that perform the following:

  * Select **device disconnection events**.

  * Select **device connection events**.

  * Join these two streams together using the Stream Analytics DATEDIFF operation on the LEFT JOIN, and then filter out any records where there was a match. This gives us devices that had a disconnect event, but no corresponding connect event within 120 seconds. Output to the Service Bus.

  * Execute the original hot path query.

12. Replace the existing query with the following, and click **Save** in the **command bar** at the top. (Be sure to substitute in your output aliases and input aliases):
    ```
    WITH
    Disconnected AS (
    SELECT *
    FROM connections TIMESTAMP BY [Time]
    WHERE OperationName = 'deviceDisconnect'
        AND Category = 'Connections'
    ),
    Connected AS (
    SELECT *
    FROM connections TIMESTAMP BY [Time]
    WHERE OperationName = 'deviceConnect'
        AND Category = 'Connections'
    )

    SELECT Disconnected.DeviceId, Disconnected.Time
    INTO [powerbi-outage] 
    FROM Disconnected
    LEFT JOIN Connected 
        ON DATEDIFF(second, Disconnected, Connected) BETWEEN 0 AND 120
        AND Connected.deviceId = Disconnected.deviceId
    WHERE Connected.DeviceId IS NULL;

    SELECT AVG(temp) AS Average, id
    INTO powerbi
    FROM temps
    GROUP BY TumblingWindow(minute, 5), id;
    ```

13. Select **Save,** and **Yes** when prompted with the confirmation.

    ![Save button](./media/image57.png "Save button")

14. Return to the Overview blade on your Stream Analytics job, and select **Start**.

    ![The start button on the Overview blade is highlighted](./media/image58.png "Overview blade start button")

15. In the Start job blade, select **Now** (the job will start processing messages from the current point in time onward).
    
    ![Next to Job output start time, the Now button is selected.](./media/image59.png "Now button")

16. Select **Start**.

17. Allow your Stream Analytics Job a few minutes to start.

### Task 3: Test the device outage notifications

Register and activate a few devices on the Smart Meter Simulator, then connect them. Deactivate them without reconnecting in order for them to show up in the device outage report we will create in the next task.

1.  Run the Smart Meter Simulator from Visual Studio.

2.  Click the **Register** button.
    
    ![Register button](./media/image105.png "Register button")
