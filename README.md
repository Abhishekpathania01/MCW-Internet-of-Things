* IoT

## Abstract

### Workshop

This workshop will guide you through an implementation of an end-to-end IoT solution simulating high velocity data emitted from smart meters and analyzed in Azure. You will design a lambda architecture, filtering a subset of the telemetry data for real-time visualization on the hot path, and storing all the data in long-term storage for the cold path. After completing the workshop, you will have a better understanding of implementing device registration with the IoT Hub Device Provisioning Service and visualizing hot data with Power BI.

### Whiteboard design session

In this whiteboard design session, you will work with a group to design an implementation of an end-to-end IoT solution simulating high velocity data emitted from smart meters and analyzed in Azure. You will design a lambda architecture, filtering a subset of the telemetry data for real-time visualization on the hot path, and storing all the data in long-term storage for the cold path. After completing the whiteboard design session, you will have a better understanding of implementing device registration with the IoT Hub Device Provisioning Service and visualizing hot data with Power BI.

### Hand-on lab

In this hands-on lab, you will implement an end-to-end IoT solution simulating high velocity data emitted from smart meters and analyzed in Azure. You will design a lambda architecture, filtering a subset of the telemetry data for real-time visualization on the hot path, and storing all the data in long-term storage for the cold path. After completing the hands-on lab, you will have a better understanding of implementing device registration with the IoT Hub Device Provisioning Service and visualizing hot data with Power BI.
