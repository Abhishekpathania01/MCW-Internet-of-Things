# Abstract

## Workshop

This workshop is designed to guide you through an implementation of an end-to-end IoT solution simulating high velocity data emitted from smart meters and analyzed in Azure. In this session, you will design a lambda architecture, filtering a subset of the telemetry data for real-time visualization on the hot path, and storing all the data in long-term storage for the cold path. After completing the package, you will be better able to implement device registration with the IoT Hub registry and visualize hot data with Power BI.

Learning objectives:

-   Implement a simulator sending telemetry from smart meters

-   Capture and process both hot and cold data using Stream Analytics and HDInsight with Spark

-   Visualize hot data with Power BI
