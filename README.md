Fabrikam provides services and smart meters for enterprise energy (electrical power) management. Their “You-Left-The-Light-On” service enables the enterprise to understand their energy consumption.

## Target audience

- Application developer
- IoT

## Abstract

### Workshop

This workshop will guide you through an implementation of an end-to-end IoT solution simulating high velocity data emitted from smart meters and analyzed in Azure. You will design a lambda architecture, filtering a subset of the telemetry data for real-time visualization on the hot path, and storing all the data in long-term storage for the cold path.

At the end of this workshop, you will be better able to construct an IoT solution implementing device registration with the IoT Hub Device Provisioning Service and visualizing hot data with Power BI.

### Whiteboard design session

In this whiteboard design session, you will work with a group to design an implementation of an end-to-end IoT solution simulating high velocity data emitted from smart meters and analyzed in Azure. You will design a lambda architecture, filtering a subset of the telemetry data for real-time visualization on the hot path, and storing all the data in long-term storage for the cold path.

At the end of this whiteboard design session, you will be better able to design an IoT solution implementing device registration with the IoT Hub Device Provisioning Service and visualizing hot data with Power BI.

### Hand-on lab

In this hands-on lab, you will construct an end-to-end IoT solution simulating high velocity data emitted from smart meters and analyzed in Azure. You will design a lambda architecture, filtering a subset of the telemetry data for real-time visualization on the hot path, and storing all the data in long-term storage for the cold path.

At the end of this hands-on lab, you will be better able to build an IoT solution implementing device registration with the IoT Hub Device Provisioning Service and visualizing hot data with Power BI.
